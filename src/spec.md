# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current proposal page with a brand-new, simple, cute single-page proposal experience in English, addressed to Ahana and clearly from Suvo, using the best 2 uploaded photos.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign the proposal UI into a minimal single-page layout (hero + short message + photos + proposal moment) with a warm, cute aesthetic (avoid a blue/purple primary palette).
- Select exactly two best-looking unique photos from the four uploads and add them as static frontend assets; render them responsively with sensible cropping and non-identifying descriptive alt text.
- Add a simple proposal interaction (one step, or at most two) that ends with a celebratory “Yes” outcome addressed to Ahana and attributed to Suvo, with an optional lightweight celebration effect that respects prefers-reduced-motion.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a clean, cute proposal page from Suvo to Ahana featuring two photos and a simple “Yes” moment with a small celebration (reduced/disabled if motion reduction is enabled).
