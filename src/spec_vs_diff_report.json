  "summary": "REQ-24 and most of REQ-25 appear implemented via a text-centric single-page layout (hero, love letter, reasons, CTA) and a simple 2-step Valentine CTA component. However, the diff summary indicates photo assets are still present and described as being displayed, which conflicts with the text-only/no-photos requirement (REQ-23). The diff summary also indicates additional interactive components (e.g., a 4-step flow) that were not requested and may conflict with the “simple interaction” constraint.",
