  "summary": "Diff implements a new single-page proposal layout (hero + message + proposal moment) and adds a new 2-step proposal component. However, evidence is insufficient that the selected photos were actually added as static assets, and it’s not fully clear that the experience is consistently attributed to “Suvo” in on-page copy. Diff also includes/retains extra components (multi-step flow, surprise reveal) and an external promotional footer link that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Add exactly two selected uploaded photos as static frontend assets (not backend-served) and reference them by filename; render them responsively with object-fit and descriptive alt text.",
      "reason": "The page references exactly two filenames (IMG_3752.jpeg and IMG_3753.jpeg) and includes alt text, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added to the frontend static assets directory (e.g., frontend/public/assets/...). Without asset additions shown, it’s not verifiable that the images are stored as static frontend assets as required.",

      "requirement": "All visible text clearly indicates it is from Suvo to Ahana (English), in a simple cute single-page proposal layout.",
      "reason": "The page is clearly addressed to Ahana, but the main page sections shown don’t explicitly say “from Suvo” (the only clear attribution in-page appears to be 'Ahana & Suvo' in the celebration and the document title). The requirement asks that the proposal experience clearly be from Suvo, which is not consistently evident in the visible body copy provided in the diff snippet.",

      "reason": "The new proposal moment triggers a confetti effect via <ConfettiBurst />, but the diff snippet does not include ConfettiBurst implementation or any prefers-reduced-motion handling within SimpleProposalMoment itself, so reduced-motion compliance for the celebration effect can’t be verified from the provided diff.",
