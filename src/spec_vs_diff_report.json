Additionally, Internet Identity/auth-related hooks and provider wiring were added despite being a non-goal and also touching paths marked immutable by the BuildRequest constraints.",

      "reason": "The page references the required generated asset filenames, but the diff does not include any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the assets are not actually added by this change set.",
